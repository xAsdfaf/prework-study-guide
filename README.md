# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation behind creating this webpage is to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I can build upon the basics and learn to code at a higher level throughout the bootcamp.
- I built this webpage to practice the basics, and so I can have a basic set of notes to refer back to during the bootcamp if neccesary.
- The problem it solves is keeping a place that is safe and stored on the web to incorporate notes into. It is written in such a way that I can build upon it throughout the bootcamp.
- I gained a very basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while making this project. I still have much to learn and I'm excited to dive in!
